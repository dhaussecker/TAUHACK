# 🏗️ TAUlab Feature List (Draft)

> Goal: Identify which features are **critical for MVP**, **nice-to-have**, or **future**.

---

## 🧱 A. Core (MVP) Features
Focus: Automate what Acadia did manually — tracking usage, simplifying reporting, and minimizing data entry.

### 1. Equipment Management
- [ ] Equipment list by category (Excavators, Line Painters, Trucks, etc.)
- [ ] Search, sort, and filter by type, site, or status
- [ ] Color-coded status indicators (G = good, Y = upcoming maintenance, R = due/critical)
- [ ] View engine hours, last seen time, and assigned operator
- [ ] QR code per asset for quick access to details or inspection forms

### 2. Usage Tracking (Automatic)
- [ ] IMU-based state detection (OFF / IDLE / MOVING / WORKING)
- [ ] Engine hour tracking (aggregated from state data)
- [ ] GPS-based site detection (auto-log “on-site” vs “off-site”)
- [ ] BLE tag presence detection for small unpowered assets
- [ ] Geofence-based time tracking (start/stop timers automatically)

### 3. Maintenance Management
- [ ] Automated maintenance reminders (based on hours/days)
- [ ] Mechanic dashboard (schedule maintenance, mark as complete)
- [ ] Equipment Repair Requests (ERRs) – manual or automatic
- [ ] Maintenance history log per machine

### 4. Reporting & Transparency
- [ ] Automatic, human-readable reports:
  - Usage (hours, location, activity breakdown)
  - Maintenance summary
  - Asset utilization (actual vs rental)
- [ ] CSV/PDF export for invoicing
- [ ] Email or mobile notification summaries

### 5. Mobile + Tablet Functionality
- [ ] Tablet master device per site (BLE gateway + geofence boundary)
- [ ] Offline caching and sync
- [ ] Simple UI for operators (QR scan → optional notes / ERR submission)

---

## 🧭 B. Operational / Admin Features
Focus: Reduce admin overhead and integrate data into existing workflows.

### 6. Job & Site Management
- [ ] List of job sites (with geofences and assigned equipment)
- [ ] View all equipment per site (like Acadia’s “Site View”)
- [ ] Site-level usage summaries
- [ ] Attach photos or documents (inspection images, site notes)

### 7. User Roles & Permissions
- [ ] Admin (full access)
- [ ] Mechanic (maintenance & ERR)
- [ ] Operator (QR scan + view assigned equipment)
- [ ] Viewer (client/subcontractor access)

### 8. Subcontractor / Client Portal
- [ ] View assigned equipment and reports
- [ ] Submit timesheets or approvals
- [ ] Client signature or proof-of-work verification

### 9. Data Integrations
- [ ] Export to QuickBooks, Sage, or Excel
- [ ] Simple CSV import/export
- [ ] Optional API endpoint (Procore, custom ERP)

### 10. Notifications & Alerts
- [ ] After-hours engine-on alerts
- [ ] Geofence breach (“equipment left site”)
- [ ] Maintenance due/overdue notifications
- [ ] BLE tag low battery/disconnected alerts

## ⚙️ C. Advanced / Phase 2+ Features
Focus: Analytics, AI, and ecosystem differentiation.

### 11. Analytics & Insights
- [ ] Equipment utilization dashboards
- [ ] Cost-per-hour and cost-per-site analytics
- [ ] Owned vs rented utilization comparison
- [ ] Operator productivity (auto-linked by geofence)
- [ ] Custom KPI dashboards

### 12. Predictive Maintenance (AI / ML)
- [ ] Vibration signature analysis
- [ ] Predict time-to-failure or service intervals
- [ ] Auto-schedule maintenance based on patterns

### 13. Multi-Fleet & Multi-Tenant Support
- [ ] Manage multiple companies or subcontractors
- [ ] Invite external partners with limited access
- [ ] Cross-fleet aggregated dashboards

### 14. Hardware Ecosystem Expansion
- [ ] OEM telematics integration (CAT, Volvo, Bobcat)
- [ ] OTA firmware updates for BLE/IMU devices
- [ ] Integration with external sensors (fuel, temperature, hydraulics)

### 15. Compliance & Documentation
- [ ] Daily inspection logs (auto or QR-triggered)
- [ ] Safety checklist uploads
- [ ] Full audit trail of usage and maintenance records

## 🎨 D. Design Principles (Inspired by Acadia)
- “Lots of data, but simple data.”  
- Spreadsheet-style interface with color-coded rows.  
- Clean, light background (`#FAF9F8` or `#D9D9D9`).  
- Equipment cards open into minimal detail views.  
- One-click exports and transparent data flow.

### ✅ Next Steps
Use checkboxes to mark each feature:
- **Critical (MVP)** — Must-have for launch.
- **Important** — Needed soon after pilot.
- **Future** — Adds differentiation or polish.
